Request:
nested class Reader/Parser


every Request has a Reader that's initialized with the Request
internal static map of buffers (so the remainder of a later request dont get lost)

throws exceptions specifying which error occurred
caught in Client or Exchange?

Reader is responsible for determining when a request is finished,
and will save the remainder in its internal buffer
