Rewrite CGI to use 2 pipes instead of in/out file
write legible checks for status_codes
introduce defines for status codes
remove magic numbers:
	max_connections
	'8' in Request::parseLine()
	'80' in Request::parseLine() <- DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT
split big functions:
	get_lines
	webserver::run

make sure every socket only gets read from once with every select call!!

get rid of "42 coplien" unused useless functions

bundle resources in the most appropriate container
(Clients in Server, Request&Response in Client)

URI might be a little overkill, could remove it possibly (?)

MAYBE:
create a class for StatusCode
- checks for specific tiers of status codes (2xx, 4xx, etc)
- tier() to return an enum referring to the tier of the status code

make Makefile rules dependant on HPP files being up to date as well
